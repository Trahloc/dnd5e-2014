# D&D 5e (2014 Edition) - Foundry VTT System

A community fork of the official D&D 5e system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, preserving the 2014 edition ruleset. This system can coexist with the official D&D 5e system, allowing you to maintain campaigns using the original ruleset.

## üéØ Purpose

This fork preserves the D&D 5e system at version 3.3.1, which represents the 2014 edition rules before the switch over from SRD to official WOTC content. It's designed for:

- **Legacy Campaigns**: Keep your existing campaigns running with the original ruleset
- **Preference for 2014 Rules**: Continue using the familiar 2014 edition mechanics
- **Compatibility**: Run alongside the official system without conflicts
